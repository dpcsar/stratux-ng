# Example hostapd config for Stratux-NG Wi‑Fi AP
#
# This is a TEMPLATE. Adjust for your hardware/country/channel/security requirements.
#
# For single-radio AP+STA, use a virtual AP interface (commonly ap0)
# created from wlan0. See docs/wifi-ap-hostapd-dnsmasq.md.
interface=ap0

# Use nl80211 with modern drivers.
driver=nl80211

# Country code matters for channel availability.
# Set this to your country (e.g., US, GB, DE, ...).
country_code=US

# SSID shown to clients (EFBs).
ssid=stratux-ng

# 2.4 GHz is widely compatible with tablets.
# hw_mode=g uses 2.4 GHz. Consider channel 1/6/11 for coexistence.
hw_mode=g
channel=6

# Enable 802.11n (optional)
ieee80211n=1
wmm_enabled=1

# Security: OPEN network (no WPA/WPA2)
#
# This removes the passphrase prompt for clients, but it is less secure.
# If you want WPA2-PSK instead, see the optional block below.
auth_algs=1

# --------
# WPA2-PSK (OPTIONAL)
# --------
# Uncomment to require a passphrase.
# wpa=2
# wpa_key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
# rsn_pairwise=CCMP
# wpa_passphrase=stratux-ng-please-change

# --------
# WPS (OPTIONAL)
# --------
# WARNING: WPS reduces Wi‑Fi security. Enable only if you accept the tradeoff.
# Many tablets (notably iOS) do not support WPS in the UI.
# NOTE: WPS requires WPA2 (it does not work with an open network).
#
# To enable WPS (PBC), uncomment the block below and then trigger with:
#   sudo hostapd_cli -i ap0 wps_pbc
#
# wps_state=2
# ap_setup_locked=0
# eap_server=1
# device_name=Stratux-NG
# manufacturer=Stratux-NG
# model_name=Stratux-NG
# model_number=1
# serial_number=0001
# config_methods=virtual_push_button physical_push_button keypad

# If you want WPS PIN mode, hostapd supports it, but it is not recommended.
# See hostapd documentation for wps_pin_requests / configuration methods.

# --------
# Notes for "AP + internet uplink"
# --------
# WPS applies to the AP side only (EFB -> Pi AP).
# For single-radio AP+STA, keep wlan0 as STA and run this AP on ap0.
